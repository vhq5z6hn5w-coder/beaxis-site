# 002 — Closure

## Scope Note

This document observes how closure occurs in systems when no explicit human decision-holder is present.  
It does not evaluate intent, correctness, ethics, or outcomes.  
It records observable behavior only.

---

## Observation

Across automated and semi-automated systems, states increasingly reach “closed” without a discrete human decision.

Examples include:
- Cases marked as resolved due to inactivity.
- Requests approved or rejected after predefined timeouts.
- Appeals expiring without review.
- Conflicting states (success/error) left unaddressed while downstream processes proceed.
- Escalation paths that exist formally but do not alter outcomes when invoked.

In these situations, no individual can point to a moment where a human explicitly accepted responsibility for closure.

The system proceeds regardless.

---

## Pattern

Closure shifts from being an act of decision to a function of time, thresholds, or procedural completion.

As this shift occurs:
- Closure becomes implicit rather than declared.
- Responsibility becomes diffuse rather than assigned.
- Continuation is treated as confirmation.

The system behaves as if a decision was made, even when none can be identified.

---

## Failure Mode

Closure without an accountable decisor produces states that are formally complete but causally unresolved.

In this mode:
- The absence of intervention is interpreted as consent.
- Delay substitutes for judgment.
- Finality is achieved without acceptance of responsibility.

The system remains operational while the origin of closure cannot be traced to a human actor.

---

## Non-Claims

This document does not:
- Assert that closure without decision is wrong or harmful.
- Attribute intent to system designers or operators.
- Propose alternative designs or safeguards.
- Predict future outcomes.
- Claim authority over interpretation.

No recommendation is made.

## Open Questions

- What constitutes a valid closure when no decision is recorded?
- Is inaction equivalent to consent?
- Can responsibility exist after automated closure?
- At what point does continuation imply endorsement?
- How is accountability reconstructed once closure has occurred?

These questions remain unresolved.
