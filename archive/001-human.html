    <strong>Scope Note</strong> — This document records a recurring human pattern
    observable across history, present systems, and projected futures.
    It does not assess intent, morality, intelligence, or blame.
    It records continuity.

  <h2>Observation</h2>
  <p>
    Across history, present systems, and projected futures, a consistent pattern
    appears when systems continue operating without requiring an explicitly
    accountable human decision-holder.
  </p>

  <p>
    The human gradually de-centers.
    Not through removal, but through fatigue.
    Not through failure, but through continuity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Biologically, socially, and cognitively, the human adapts to sustained noise.
    Signals overlap.
    Closure is demanded everywhere.
    The body remains present while agency thins.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Pattern</h2>
  <p>
    When systems resolve by default, the human shifts from decisor to responder.
    From actor to monitor.
    From source of closure to surface-level confirmer.
  </p>

  <p>
    This shift rarely announces itself.
    It accumulates.
    Over time, responsibility fades without explicit handoff.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Failure Mode</h2>
  <p>
    The failure is not collapse.
    The system continues.
    Outputs remain.
    Metrics report success.
  </p>

  <p>
    What fails quietly is sustained human authorship.
    Decision-making persists without a felt center.
  </p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Non-Claims</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This is not consulting</li>
    <li>This is not alignment</li>
    <li>This is not optimization</li>
    <li>This is not governance</li>
    <li>This does not prescribe intervention</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Open Questions</h2>
  <p>
    At what point does adaptation become absence?
    And how would a human notice the difference without stopping the system?
