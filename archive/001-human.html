  <h2>Observation</h2>
  <p>
    In high-noise environments, the human does not “choose” so much as <em>accept</em>.
    The stream becomes continuous. Signals conflict. Authority is fragmented.
    A person can become hyper-observant, not as mastery, but as overload.
  </p>
  <p>
    When closure is demanded everywhere, the body pays the bill: sleep breaks, vigilance rises, and the mind searches for anchors.
    People anesthetize—not always with substances, sometimes with scrolling, certainty, or belonging.
  </p>

  <h2>Pattern</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Too many competing truths → attention turns into defense.</li>
    <li>Defense becomes identity → identity becomes closure.</li>
    <li>Closure reduces pain short-term → increases drift long-term.</li>
    <li>Drift is tolerated because the system still “works”.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Failure Mode</h2>
  <p>
    Responsibility fades without any explicit decision.
    Not because someone chose to abandon it—because the environment makes non-decision the default.
    The human becomes the last component expected to absorb contradiction.
  </p>

  <h2>Non-Claims</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This is not a statement about any single ideology, party, platform, or institution.</li>
    <li>This is not a moral judgment of individuals reacting under stress.</li>
    <li>This does not assert what is true about any specific event.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Open Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Where did closure happen first—inside the person, or inside the system around them?</li>
    <li>What would “pause before closure” look like in daily life without becoming paralysis?</li>
    <li>Which anchors restore agency without creating a new dependency?</li>
  </ul>
