  <h1>002 — Closure</h1>

  <hr />

  <h2>Scope Note</h2>
  <p>
    This document observes how closure occurs in systems when no explicit human decision-holder is present.
    It does not evaluate intent, correctness, ethics, or outcomes.
    It records observable behavior only.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Observation</h2>
  <p>
    Across automated and semi-automated systems, states increasingly reach “closed” without a discrete human decision.
  </p>

  <p>Examples include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cases marked as resolved due to inactivity.</li>
    <li>Requests approved or rejected after predefined timeouts.</li>
    <li>Appeals expiring without review.</li>
    <li>Conflicting states (success/error) left unaddressed while downstream processes proceed.</li>
    <li>Escalation paths that exist formally but do not alter outcomes when invoked.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In these situations, no individual can point to a moment where a human explicitly accepted responsibility for closure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The system proceeds regardless.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Pattern</h2>
  <p>
    Closure shifts from being an act of decision to a function of time, thresholds, or procedural completion.
  </p>

  <p>As this shift occurs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Closure becomes implicit rather than declared.</li>
    <li>Responsibility becomes diffuse rather than assigned.</li>
    <li>Continuation is treated as confirmation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The system behaves as if a decision was made, even when none can be identified.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Failure Mode</h2>
  <p>
    Closure without an accountable decisor produces states that are formally complete but causally unresolved.
  </p>

  <p>In this mode:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The absence of intervention is interpreted as consent.</li>
    <li>Delay substitutes for judgment.</li>
    <li>Finality is achieved without acceptance of responsibility.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The system remains operational while the origin of closure cannot be traced to a human actor.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Non-Claims</h2>
  <p>This document does not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Assert that closure without decision is wrong or harmful.</li>
    <li>Attribute intent to system designers or operators.</li>
    <li>Propose alternative designs or safeguards.</li>
    <li>Predict future outcomes.</li>
    <li>Claim authority over interpretation.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>No recommendation is made.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Open Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What constitutes a valid closure when no decision is recorded?</li>
    <li>Is inaction equivalent to consent?</li>
    <li>Can responsibility exist after automated closure?</li>
    <li>At what point does continuation imply endorsement?</li>
    <li>How is accountability reconstructed once closure has occurred?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These questions remain unresolved.
