<h1>006 — Dependency</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Scope Note</h2>

<p>
This document does not propose solutions.
It does not recommend mitigation strategies.
It does not define best practices.
</p>

<p>
It records a single observable condition.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Observation</h2>

<p>
Independent observation increasingly operates on dependent infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
The observer retains agency of interpretation,
but not agency over the substrate that enables observation.
</p>

<p>
The tools used to observe, record, and publish
are governed by systems the observer cannot inspect,
audit, or stabilize.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Pattern</h2>

<p>
This condition appears when:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Observation is mediated by third-party platforms</li>
  <li>Continuity is controlled externally</li>
  <li>Changes to the system may occur without notification</li>
  <li>The observer cannot distinguish drift from intent</li>
</ul>

<p>
The dependency is not contractual.
It is infrastructural.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Key Distinction</h2>

<p>
This is not censorship.
</p>

<p>
This is not surveillance.
</p>

<p>
This is not malice.
</p>

<p>
It is an asymmetry of control.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Consequence</h2>

<p>
When dependency exists at the infrastructure level,
the observer may continue operating
without knowing whether the system has changed.
</p>

<p>
Continuity is preserved.
Accountability is diffused.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Boundary</h2>

<p>
This document does not argue for independence.
</p>

<p>
It records that independence of judgment
can coexist with dependency of execution.
</p>

<p>
This tension is structural.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Closing</h2>

<p>
The observer remains responsible for what is produced.
</p>

<p>
The system remains responsible only for its segment.
</p>

<p>
No reconciliation is proposed.
