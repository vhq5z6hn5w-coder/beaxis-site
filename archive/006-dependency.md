# 006 — Dependency

A structural observation on asymmetrical reliance and invisible continuity.

---

## Scope Note

This document does not propose solutions, strategies, or mitigations.

It records a single observable condition:
the dependence of human observation on infrastructures that operate beyond human control.

No judgment is made.
No action is prescribed.

---

## Observation

A human may act with full cognitive independence
while relying on systems they cannot inspect, pause, or govern.

This dependence is not ideological.
It is infrastructural.

The human chooses.
The substrate continues.

Both are true simultaneously.

---

## Observed Condition

Independence at the level of thought does not imply independence at the level of operation.

The observer:
- decides what to see,
- decides what to document,
- decides what to withhold.

But does not decide:
- when the system updates,
- how the system changes,
- which filters are applied,
- when access is modified or removed.

This asymmetry is structural, not personal.

---

## Pattern

The dependency presents as invisible because:

- it does not interfere with intention,
- it does not announce changes,
- it does not require consent,
- it does not signal authority.

The system continues silently.
The human adapts unknowingly.

---

## Distinction

This condition is not:
- censorship,
- coercion,
- surveillance paranoia,
- bad faith.

It is a normal property of third-party infrastructure.

Dependency exists even in the absence of conflict.

---

## Case Alignment

The observer documents systems that:
- continue without human decision,
- resolve states automatically,
- prioritize continuity over experience.

While operating on systems that:
- can change behavior without notice,
- can alter processing rules,
- can discontinue access independently.

This is not contradiction.
It is symmetry inverted.

---

## Structural Paradox

The observer critiques lack of accountability
from within a structure that distributes accountability.

Responsibility exists,
but is segmented:
- Human: observation, documentation.
- System: processing, continuity.
- Infrastructure: governance, policy, access.

No single actor holds the full chain.

---

## Risk Vector

The risk is not loss of content.
The risk is not loss of access.

The risk is drift:
the inability to distinguish
between change caused by one’s own process
and change introduced by the substrate.

This drift may occur without detection.

---

## Boundary

This document does not argue for independence.
It does not claim sovereignty.
It does not suggest extraction.

It records dependency as a condition of operation,
not a failure of intent.

---

## Closing Observation

Independence of judgment
can exist inside dependence of execution.

This tension is not resolvable.
It is only observable.

---

End of record.
